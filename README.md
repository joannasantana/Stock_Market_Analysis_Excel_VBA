# VBA-Challenge

Stock market analysis project using Excel and VBA Scripting.

Given an excel spreadsheet containing stock market data from the years 2018-2020, I created a VBA code that will analyze the data of all 3 years at once and output summary data for each stock, as well as determine which stock performed the best and which performed the worst. The dataset analyzed includes every day of trading for 3,000 stocks to total 75,900 lines of data for each year.
